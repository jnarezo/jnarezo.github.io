I think my **_favorite_ programming language** is C# or ~~JavaScript~~, mostly
because of the simple functional programming, lambdas, and implementation of
some C++ concepts (specifically for C#).

But if I had to order them:
1. Glaceon
   - ~~Best eveelution~~
2. Mareep
3. Breloom
4. Milotic
5. Pichu

Things I want to do:

- [] Add rendering to my NES emulator using WebGL for the web.
- [] Port the NES emulator using WASM.

Bye~
